  abstract  = {Accurate delay prediction is important in the early stages of logic and high-level synthesis. In technology mapping for field programmable gate array (FPGA), a gate-level circuit is transcribed into a lookup table (LUT)-level circuit. Quick timing analysis is necessary on a pre-mapped circuit to guide optimizations downstream. However, a static timing analyzer is too slow due to its complexity and highly inaccurate like other faster empirical heuristics before technology mapping. In this work, we present a machine learning based framework for accurately and efficiently estimating the delay of a gate-level circuit from predicting the depth of the corresponding LUT logic after technology mapping. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a 56x accuracy improvement compared to the existing delay estimation heuristic. Instead of running the mapper for the ground truth, our delay estimator saves 87.5% on runtime with negligible error.},

Generative self-supervised learning can generate new data based on the trained data distribution. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of generative self-supervised learning on combinational gate sizing in VLSI designs. We propose a novel use of Transformers for gate sizing when trained on a large dataset generate from a commercial EDA tool. We demonstrate that our trained model can achieve 93% accuracy, 1440X speedup and fast design convergence when compared to a leading commercial EDA tool.},
