  abstract  = {Continuous scaling of the VLSI system leaves a great challenge on manufacturing and optical proximity correction (OPC) is widely applied in conventional design flow for manufacturability optimization. Traditional techniques conducted OPC by leveraging a lithography model and suffered from prohibitive computational overhead, and mostly focused on optimizing a single clip without addressing how to tackle the full chip. In this paper, we present DAMO, a high performance and scalable deep learning-enabled OPC system for full chip scale. It is an end-to-end mask optimization paradigm which contains a Deep Lithography Simulator (DLS) for lithography modeling and a Deep Mask Generator (DMG) for mask pattern generation. Moreover, a novel layout splitting algorithm customized for DAMO is proposed to handle the full chip OPC problem. Extensive experiments show that DAMO outperforms the state-of-the-art OPC solutions in both academia and industrial commercial toolkit.}

  abstract  = {With the feature size continuously shrinking in advanced technology nodes, mask optimization is increasingly crucial in the conventional design flow, accompanied by an explosive growth in prohibitive computational overhead in optical proximity correction (OPC) methods. Recently, inverse lithography technique (ILT) has drawn significant attention and is becoming prevalent in emerging OPC solutions. However, ILT methods are either time-consuming or in weak performance of mask printability and manufacturability. In this paper, we present DevelSet, a GPU and deep neural network (DNN) accelerated level set OPC framework for metal layer. We first improve the conventional level set-based ILT algorithm by introducing the curvature term to reduce mask complexity and applying GPU acceleration to overcome computational bottlenecks. To further enhance printability and fast iterative convergence, we propose a novel deep neural network delicately designed with level set intrinsic principles to facilitate the joint optimization of DNN and GPU accelerated level set optimizer. Experimental results show that DevelSet framework surpasses the state-of-theart methods in printability and boost the runtime performance achieving instant level (around 1 second).}

  abstract  = {Lithography simulation is a critical step in VLSI design and optimization for manufacturability. Existing solutions for highly accurate lithography simulation with rigorous models are computationally expensive and slow, even when equipped with various approximation techniques. Recently, machine learning has provided alternative solutions for lithography simulation tasks such as coarse-grained edge placement error regression and complete contour prediction. However, the impact of these learning-based methods has been limited due to restrictive usage scenarios or low simulation accuracy. To tackle these concerns, we introduce an dual-band optics-inspired neural network design that considers the optical physics underlying lithography. To the best of our knowledge, our approach yields the first published via/metal layer contour simulation at 1nm2/pixel resolution with any tile size. Compared to previous machine learning based solutions, we demonstrate that our framework can be trained much faster and offers a significant improvement on efficiency and image quality with 20\texttimes{} smaller model size. We also achieve 85\texttimes{} simulation speedup over traditional lithography simulator with ~ 1% accuracy loss.},

  abstract  = {Mask optimization has been a critical problem in the VLSI design flow due to the mismatch between the lithography system and the continuously shrinking feature sizes. Optical proximity correction (OPC) is one of the prevailing resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) that can significantly improve mask printability. However, in advanced technology nodes, the mask optimization process consumes more and more computational resources. In this paper, we develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to achieve better mask optimization performance. We first develop an OPC-oriented GAN flow that can learn target-mask mapping from the improved architecture and objectives, which leads to satisfactory mask optimization results. To facilitate the training process and ensure better convergence, we also propose a pre-training procedure that jointly trains the neural network with inverse lithography technique (ILT). At convergence, the generative network is able to create quasi-optimal masks for given target circuit patterns and fewer normal OPC steps are required to generate high quality masks. Experimental results show that our flow can facilitate the mask optimization process as well as ensure a better printability.},
